The theme of the project is  Design and implementation of directed and weighted graphs in Python.
## Main algorithm's
   methods of the interface:
- create a graph (it's optional to add vertexes and edges)
- init: Init the graph on which this set of algorithms operates on
- copy: Compute a deep copy of a weighted graph.
- Isconected: check if the graph is strongly connected (there is a valid path from each node to each other node).
- shortestPath: returns list of nodes of the shortest path between source vertex to destination vertex consider the weight of each edge.
- centerPoint: Finds the node which minimizes the max distance to all the other nodes.
- tsp: Computes a list of consecutive nodes which go over all the nodes in cities.
- save: save your graph in JSON format.
- load: load a graph from a JSON format.
- plot_graph: Plots the graph.

  algorithms that we buit to help us implements the methods of the intreface:
 - lowest_dist: calculate the lowest dist between two given nodes.
 - Dijkstra_algorithm_path: Find the shortest route for any pair node,
 - is_connected:check if the given grapg is strongly connected
 - DFS:Depth-first search
